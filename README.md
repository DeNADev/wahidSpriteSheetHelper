wahidSpriteSheetHelper
======================

This is an Adobe Flash Extension that makes it easy to handle sprite sheets.
This extension embeds sprite sheet information into a Javascript file published from a Flash document and edits it into a form suitable for the [Wahid](https://github.com/denadev/wahid/) library.

If you use Adobe Flash Processional CS6, you can use [Flash Professional Toolkit for CreateJS](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/createjs.html) and [toolkit-supporter](https://code.google.com/archive/p/toolkit-supporter/) instead of this extension.

# Quick Start
1. Download and install Adobe Flash Professional CC(2014) (Flash) via [Adobe Creative Cloud desktop application](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/desktop-app.html).
1. Download and install Adobe Extension Manager CC in the same way.
1. Double click [wahidSpriteSheetHelper.zxp](./exported/wahidSpriteSheetHelper.zxp) to install it.
1. Create a HTML5 Canvas document on Flash.
1. Embed image files in the Flash document.
1. Set up JavaScript/HTML5 publish settings in "File" -> "Publish settings" on the application menu and publish it.
1. Generate a sprite sheet with Flash standard function.  Choose "JSON-ARRAY" as the data format, and select the image directory that you previously published for the output destination.
1. Open the extension in "Window" -> "Extension" -> "wahidSpriteSheetHelper" on the application menu.
1. Check the "Remove individual image files." checkbox if you want.
1. Click the "Execute" button.
1. Check the published file works fine.

# How to build the extension
This is an Adobe Flash Extension project, so we should install the extension development environment.  See [this article](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/extensionbuilder3/) and install the follows;
* [Eclipse 3.6 or later](http://www.eclipse.org/)
* [Extension Bulider 3 Preview 3](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/extensionbuilder3.html)
* [Extendscript Toolkit CC (if you want)](https://creative.adobe.com/products/estk)

Of cource, we need the Flash as an operating environment.
* Adobe Flash Professional(2014)
* Adobe Extension Manager CC

Adobe [said](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/extensionbuilder3/) that "Adobe Extension Builder 3 preview 3 is not compatible with Adobe Creative Cloud 2014 applications".  So we have to [tweak the Extension Builder](https://blogs.adobe.com/cssdk/2014/06/adobe-extension-builder-and-creative-cloud-2014.html).

Note
* At the Step 2: If "Service Manager Root Folder" does not exists, create it.
* At the Step 3: The editted Manifest.xml will be overwriten when you use the "Manifest Builder", so you have to re-edit the Manifest.xml.

The environment settings is over.  Next, download the project resources and build the extension in the Eclipse

```shell
# git clone https://github.com/DeNADev/wahidSpriteSheetHelper.git
# cd wahidSpriteSheetHelper
# cd ExtensionContent
# npm install jed
```

* Launch the Eclipse, create new workspace.
* To import the extension project, click "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace" on the application menu.
* To build the extension, click "File" -> "Export" -> "Adobe Extension Builder 3" -> "Application Extension" on the menu.

You can build and export it now.
